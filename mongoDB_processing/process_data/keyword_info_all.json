This issue has been fixed, and the app is as amazing as ever!", "Nice options for color, saturation, etc.", "PowerDirector Mobile Review --- Barry \u201cthe crab\u201d --- After decades of editing video with PowerDirector, and strictly on a Windows PC, I recently tried out Cyberlink\u2019s mobile version of their flagship software on my Android tablet and iOS smart phone, and was absolutely thrilled at how easy and how fun it was to use. PowerDirector Mobile is an embarrassment of riches. Upon first trying it I was quickly tapping and swiping my way through an impressive array of tools that let me easily put together engaging videos, up to 4k, using my handheld devices. PowerDirector Mobile almost feels like a full-fledged desktop application straight from the splash screen. You get a choice of three aspect ratios, 16:9, 9:16, and square 1:1. As soon as you enter your new project interface, you are presented with a timeline and three Library tabs: Video, Image, and Audio, all of which generate thumbnails showing your available media files and folders. There are also links to free and premium video and audio content from the Cyberlink cloud to enhance your latest production. I have to say the quality and amount of cloud content is impressive. PowerDirector Mobile provides multiple timelines for video and images, and includes PIP ability. Cyberlink also provides dozens of free and premium PIP themed animations. Multiple timelines also exist for audio or voiceover, and Cyberlink added more audio timelines as I was writing this! The menu of editing controls and FX is easy to use and actually quite surprising in how much ground they cover. Keep in mind this is a mobile application, but you are given a choice of video filter categories such as Artistic, Portrait, Food, and more, many which have sub-sets of even more filters. There are also dozens of animated titles to give your audience some eye-catching text, and though the included titles are great, you can download more from the Cyberlink cloud. Additionally for visual media you can adjust hue and saturation, brightness, contrast, sharpness, and more, all essentials. And SPEED! You can even adjust speed! Reverse, Pan and Zoom, Crop, Flip, Skin Smoother, the list goes on. For really getting your creative juices flowing the FX menu is stunning: Gaussian Blur, Mirror, Laser, Sepia, Glass, TV Wall, Filter Color, Style Packs. Dozens more. So many FX you might forget you are on a mobile device. This thing even does Chroma key, Blending, and Masking! This app is simply a blast to use, but it isn\u2019t simple under the hood. Again I have to give kudos to PowerDirector Mobile for it\u2019s large number of choices and how easy it is to use. When you are ready to let the world see your sure-to-win-a-major-award masterpiece you can save your new file or upload it directly to your social media accounts on Youtube or Facebook. My only real beef was more with my tablet processor than with PD Mobile itself. PowerDirector Mobile analyzes your system when you open the app and decides what it can handle for video input. My Snapdragon 429 was unable to export more than 720p, and for actual editing generate only a single video timeline , and two layered timelines capable of only images, titles, and animated Gifs. My i-phone easily surpassed this with 4k capability, multiple video, layers, and audio timelines. Disclosure: I am a long-time user of Cyberlink software and was given the PD Mobile software for my honest review. I'm an honest man and I mean it when I say this is a highly functional easy-to-use editing app.", "Good application and easy to use.Its could be nice to provide manual adjustment for colour, saturation and etc.", "Alllows background image blur among other adjustments. Almost exactly what I was looking for! And it's PERFECT for my old ASUS tablet, since it's an old app. Age has nothing to do with it's usefulness though.
